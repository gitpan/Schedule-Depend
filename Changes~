	debug uses copy of queue, doesn't consume original
	object during debug, returns original object if 
	debug is successful. see comments for use.

	updated verbose handling, now has three levels: 0, 1, 2.
	0 == stop/start messages and nastygrams, 1 == progress
	messages from fork/reap; 2 == fairly detailed.  $q->{verbose}
	overrides the debug switch; no verbose setting w/ debug
	gives verbose == 2. added description of changes to POD.

	all verbose-controlled output goes to STDOUT, nastygrams
	and que start/complete messages to STDERR.

	doc updates to reflect changes in verbosity.
