Revision history for Perl extension Schedule::Depend
(most recent first).

0.08 Fri Apr  5 10:10:08 CST 2002

 -	Added runjob to handle the result of unalias
	after the fork. If the unaliased scalar is a
	code reference then it exits with the result
	of &$job; otherwise exec's $job. 

	Using an unalias with:

		no strict 'refs';
		\&$job

	to expand the tag from the scheule allows 
	queueing subroutines -- or a mixture of
	subroutines and shell execs. This could also
	return a closure to push evaluation parameters
	even later into the cycle (or for testing).

	See notes for unalias & runjob for examples.

 -	Added switch for handling failed jobs without
	aborting the queue. This offers the same effect
	as "make -k". If "noabort => true" is passed
	into prepare then jobs that fail will have their
	dependencies marked for skipping and the pidfiles
	will get a nastygram + exit status of -1 (i.e.,
	they will be re-executed on a restart). 

	The noabort code doesn't seem to break anything,
	but has not been fully tested (yet).

 -	pidfile and output directories can be passed in with the arguments,
	picked up from the environment or default to the current
	executable's directory name. the environment method can be
	handy for the single-argument version.

 -	Serious updates to pod and comments.


0.07

	Default for $que->{alias}{logdir} and {rundir}
	are "dirname $0". Simplifies running multpile
	copies of the same file and schedule from 
	different directories via soft link.

0.06

	Remove some of the extra newlines -- they aren't
	required since individual job output goes to 
	stdout/stderr files.

	Shuffled verbose prints to a bit to give saner
	combinatins of output. At this point test.log 
	should give a reasonable idea of what slient,
	progress and detailed output look like.

	Process verbose as an alias for setting verbosity.

	Add sanity check for odd number of arg's > 1
	in prepare. Makes it harder to zap thyself by
	adding "verbose => X" after a single-value
	schedule entry.

	test.pl checks for forkatotis in the module by 
	comparing the initial pid running test.pl with
	what's running after the test_blah call; croaks
	if the pid has changed since test.pl startup.

	Updated comments, pod to reflect the changes 
	since 0.03.

	Note: Still need to come up with a reasonable
	definition for processing the debug alias/arg
	during prepare and execution. It may require
	debug levels like: 1 => don't fork, 2 => also
	don't check or write pidfiles. Problem there
	is making sure that mixing $que->debug with 
	$que->prepare( ... debug => X ) doesn't cause
	unnecessary errors.

0.05:

	Output of individual jobs goes to $logdir/$job.out
	and $logdir/$job.err. Main purpose is to keep the
	top-level schedule logs clean.

	test.pl puts stdout to test.log -- saves a lotta 
	stuff flying by on make test.

	verbose and debug arg's to prepare and execute
	are independent (i.e, you can now debug in silent
	mode and get minimal output).

0.04 Fri Mar  1 13:52:34 CST 2002

	debug uses copy of queue, doesn't consume original
	object during debug, returns original object if 
	debug is successful. see comments for use.

	updated verbose handling, now has three levels: 0, 1, 2.
	0 == stop/start messages and nastygrams, 1 == progress
	messages from fork/reap; 2 == fairly detailed.  $q->{verbose}
	overrides the debug switch; no verbose setting w/ debug
	gives verbose == 2. added description of changes to POD.

	all verbose-controlled output goes to STDOUT, nastygrams
	and que start/complete messages to STDERR.

	doc updates to reflect changes in verbosity.
