Schedule::Depend

Parallel scheduling of jobs with dependency tracking. Module allows
restarting failed queues, mixing perl subroutines and shell code in
the dependencies.

To install the module:

	perl Makefile.PL;

	make;
	make test install;

Use care replacing a working version with a new one if the new 
verison does not pass the "make test" phase.

Required additional modules & minimum versions:
	
	Data::Dumper	2.102
	File::Basename	2.6

See perl(1) and ExtUtils::MakeMaker(1) for examples of how to 
modify installation from its defaults (e.g., moving the installed
location via "perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~").
