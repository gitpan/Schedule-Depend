Revision history for Perl extension Schedule::Depend.

0.06

	Remove some of the extra newlines -- they aren't
	required since individual job output goes to 
	stdout/stderr files.

	Shuffled verobse prints to a bit to give saner
	combinatins of output. At this point test.log 
	should give a reasonable idea of what slient,
	progress and detailed output look like.

	Process verbose as an alias for setting verbosity.

	Add sanity check for odd number of arg's > 1
	in prepare. Makes it harder to zap thyself by
	adding "verbose => X" after a single-value
	schedule entry.

	test.pl checks for forkatotis in the module by 
	comparing the initial pid running test.pl with
	what's running after the test_blah call; croaks
	if the pid has changed since test.pl startup.

	Updated comments, pod to reflect the changes 
	since 0.03.

	Note: Still need to come up with a reasonable
	definition for processing the debug alias/arg
	during prepare and execution. It may require
	debug levels like: 1 => don't fork, 2 => also
	don't check or write pidfiles. Problem there
	is making sure that mixing $que->debug with 
	$que->prepare( ... debug => X ) doesn't cause
	unnecessary errors.

0.05:

	Output of individual jobs goes to $logdir/$job.out
	and $logdir/$job.err. Main purpose is to keep the
	top-level schedule logs clean.

	test.pl puts stdout to test.log -- saves a lotta 
	stuff flying by on make test.

	verbose and debug arg's to prepare and execute
	are independent (i.e, you can now debug in silent
	mode and get minimal output).

	debug uses copy of queue, doesn't consume original
	object during debug, returns original object if 
	debug is successful. see comments for use.

	updated verbose handling, now has three levels: 0, 1, 2.
	0 == stop/start messages and nastygrams, 1 == progress
	messages from fork/reap; 2 == fairly detailed.  $q->{verbose}
	overrides the debug switch; no verbose setting w/ debug
	gives verbose == 2. added description of changes to POD.

	all verbose-controlled output goes to STDOUT, nastygrams
	and que start/complete messages to STDERR.

	doc updates to reflect changes in verbosity.
