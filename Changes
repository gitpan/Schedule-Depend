Revision history for Perl extension Schedule::Depend.

0.05:

	Output of individual jobs goes to $logdir/$job.out
	and $logdir/$job.err. Main purpose is to keep the
	top-level schedule logs clean.

	test.pl puts stdout to test.log -- saves a lotta 
	stuff flying by on make test.

	debug uses copy of queue, doesn't consume original
	object during debug, returns original object if 
	debug is successful. see comments for use.

	updated verbose handling, now has three levels: 0, 1, 2.
	0 == stop/start messages and nastygrams, 1 == progress
	messages from fork/reap; 2 == fairly detailed.  $q->{verbose}
	overrides the debug switch; no verbose setting w/ debug
	gives verbose == 2. added description of changes to POD.

	all verbose-controlled output goes to STDOUT, nastygrams
	and que start/complete messages to STDERR.

	doc updates to reflect changes in verbosity.
